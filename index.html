This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. he may <i>look</i>happy, but he's a little disppointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in box.
<br><br>

Jack would really like...
<ul>
<li>Roller blades</li>
<li>Magic tricks</li>
<li>Anything pokemon</li>
<li>A motorized Lego set</li>

</ul>
